## INTRODUCTION
In most of the cases , there is no internet services during any national Disaster .Most technical apps and services shuts down during any disaster .People are not able to connect and help each other ,so we provide a solution to this .We know that people are the most precious resource during disaster even more than technical services so we are going to develop a prototype that helps people  to find nearby survivors during a disaster without using internet and network services which become mostly unavailable during such disasters. We also provide a pre-notification service for natural disasters like Tsunami, floods, earthquakes are provided from updated databases around the world. This feature will let us be informed and prepared from such disasters and help us in reducing damage.

### Our application works on three levels:
1.Pre-disaster


2.During disaster


3.Post-disaster


 
#### 1.Pre-Disaster


As we know that some disasters are predictable. A notification will be sent to the user if news of a natural disaster wandering in close proximity from his location is found. This will give him time to move to a safe location beforehand.

#### 2.During Disaster


As during natural calamities internet and network services become unavailable,
we make use of mobile hotspot to know about nearby survivors around the user in case he is stuck in the disaster. A hotspot will be created and the application will search for nearby hotspots and thus will identify nearby survivors. Our app will alternately switch between hotspot and wi-fi to identify hotspots. Nearer the person, more will be the range. This will help them in helping each other and surviving the calamity together. If the user is lucky to have network services running in his mobile, our application will automatically upload the location of the user to the cloud which can then be used by rescue teams to find them and also help the government in estimating the number of survivors. Our app also has a SOS button to call for help.

#### 3.Post-Disaster


  Our application will have a feature to send a message to the userâ€™s family and dear ones about his well-being.
